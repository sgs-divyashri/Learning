Basic Learning

1. URL
   - unique address to contain all resources on the internet.
   - has a protocol (access the resource), domain name (name of the website - host), port (connect to server), path (page navigation), query parameters (filtering), fragment (starts with #, goes to specific section within the same page)
     
2. HTTP
   - transfer of data between client and server
   - request-response model (client sends request via API to the server, Server processes request and sends back to the client via API)
   - stateless (not store previous memory)
   - text-based (stored in lain text only)
   - to create valid HTTP requests:
     - URL, HTTP methods (GET, POST), request headers, request body
   - For HTTP response,
     - HTTP status code, Response headers, response body
   - Request methods
     i. GET - to create new request
     ii. POST - to send the request
     iii. PUT - to update the request
     iv. PATCH - to update only necessary data within the resource
     v. DELETE - to delete specified resource
   - Status codes:
     i. 2xx - Successful (200 - OK, 201 - Created)
     ii. 3xx - Redirectional (301 - moved permanently)
     iii. 4xx - Client Error (404 - Not found)
     iv. 5xx - Server Error (500 - Internal Server error)
   - Advantages of HTTP:
     - requires less memory and CPU usage
   - Diadvantages of HTTP:
     - less secure as there is no encryption method
       
4. HTTPS
   - Secure version of HTTP
   - communicate between client and server
   - all data send between client and server is encrypted and can be decrypted. but hackers cannot read or modify it
     
6. JSON
   - a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
   - often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
   - The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
   - Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.
   - universal language for data
   - Example:
     {
       "name": "Divy",
       "age": 15,
       "city": "Bangalore",
       "skills": ["Python", "HTML", "CSS"],
       "student": true
     }
     
   - JSON in APIs
     Example: Request and Response
     Client Request (to a server):
     POST /user/register HTTP/1.1
     Content-Type: application/json
     {
     "username": "divy123",
     "email": "divy@gmail.com",
     "password": "12345"
     }

     Server Response:
     {
     "message": "User registered successfully",
     "user_id": 101,
     "status": "success"
     }

8. API
   - an intermediator (bridge) to allow diff software applications to communicate with each other.
   - Process:
     - Client (user) send request via URL of API.
     - API sends request to server.
     - server processes request, send back to API
     - API send response to the client
  - It is essential to:
    - intergrate between diff systems
    - automate tasks
    - monitor and update real-time applications
    - data security
      
8. REST API
   - type of API to allow communication between different systems over the internet
   - sending requests and receiving responses, typically in JSON format, between the client and server
   - an architectural design style for APIs
   - REST APIs use HTTP methods to interact with resources, but they are not the same thing.
   - defines how the APIs should behave, while HTTP defines the rules for communication over the web.
     
9. Client-Server Architecture
   - a model that describes how two systems (client and server) communicate with each other over a network (like the Internet or a local network)
   - open any browser and type a URL:
     - The browser (Client) sends a HTTP request to the Server that hosts the site.
     - The server receives the request, processes it (maybe checks a database, runs code, etc.).
     - The server sends back a HTTP response (for example: HTML, CSS, and images).
     - The client receives it and renders (shows) the website.
   - Architecture Diagram:
     User Interface Layer -----> Client (Browser App) -----> Request (HTTP/HTTPS) -----> Server (Web/DB/App) -----> Response (Data/HTML) -----> Displays Results to Client
