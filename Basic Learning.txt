   - CRUD Operations
   - Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF)
   - PostgreSQL
   
5. API
   - an intermediator (bridge) to allow diff software applications to communicate with each other.
   - Process:
     - Client (user) send request via URL of API.
     - API sends request to server.
     - server processes request, send back to API
     - API send response to the client
   - It is essential to:
     - intergrate between diff systems
     - automate tasks
     - monitor and update real-time applications
     - data security
   JSON
   - a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
   - often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
   - The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
   - Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.
   - universal language for data
   - Example:
     {
       "name": "Divy",
       "age": 15,
       "city": "Bangalore",
       "skills": ["Python", "HTML", "CSS"],
       "student": true
     }
     
   - JSON in APIs
     Example: Request and Response
     Client Request (to a server):
     POST /user/register HTTP/1.1
     Content-Type: application/json
     {
     "username": "divy123",
     "email": "divy@gmail.com",
     "password": "12345"
     }

     Server Response:
     {
     "message": "User registered successfully",
     "user_id": 101,
     "status": "success"
     }

6. REST API
   - type of API to allow communication between different systems over the internet
   - sending requests and receiving responses, typically in JSON format, between the client and server
   - an architectural design style for APIs
   - REST APIs use HTTP methods to interact with resources, but they are not the same thing.
   - defines how the APIs should behave, while HTTP defines the rules for communication over the web.

7. API Testing using Postman [Partial]

9. Data Structures [Later - Revision]
   - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
   - Searching (linear, binary)
   - Sorting (bubble, insertion, merge)

10. OS (Basics)
    - What is OS, process, memory, and threads
    - File system and permissions

11. Networking (Basics)
   a) IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
      - a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication
	   - Identifying a device on the network.
	   - Locating the device to enable communication with other devices over a network like the Internet.
	   Components of an IP Address
	   - Network Portion: Identifies the network to which the device belongs.
	   - Host Portion: Identifies the individual device on the network.
	   - Subnet Mask (for IPv4): Defines which part of the IP is network and which part is host.
	   - Example: IP 192.168.1.10 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0
	              Network ID: 192.168.1.0
		           Host ID: 10
   b) IP Address Versions
      - IPv4: 32-bit address, supports ~4 billion devices  Ex: 192.168.1.1   
      - IPv6: 128-bit address, supports more devices, future standard  Ex: 2001:0db8::1   
      Why IPv6? Because IPv4 addresses are almost exhausted  
   c) Ports
      - a 16-bit number (0-65535) that acts as a communication endpoint for a network connection, specifying which application or service on a device should receive data
	   - Combined with an IP address, a port number allows a single device to run multiple network applications simultaneously, like a web server, email client, and chat application, all using the same IP address but different ports. There are three main types of ports: well-known ports (0-1023), registered ports (1024-49151), and dynamic/private ports (49152-65535)
   
   IP Address vs. Port Number: An IP address identifies a specific device on a network, while a port number identifies a specific application or service on that device. For example, your IP address might be 192.168.1.100, but when you visit a website, the request is sent to port 80 on that IP address for the web server to handle.
   
   d) URL
      - unique address to contain all resources on the internet.
      - has a protocol (access the resource), domain name (name of the website - host), port (connect to server), path (page navigation), query parameters (filtering), fragment (starts with #, goes to specific section within the same page)
   e) DNS (Domain Name System)
      - a hierarchical and distributed naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses.
	   - When you type a domain name like www.geeksforgeeks.org into your browser, DNS ensures that the request reaches the correct server by resolving the domain to its corresponding IP address.
   f) HTTP/HTTPS
      1) HTTP
		   - transfer of data between client and server
		   - request-response model (client sends request via API to the server, Server processes request and sends back to the client via API)
		   - stateless (not store previous memory)
		   - text-based (stored in plain text only)
         - to create valid HTTP requests:
           - URL, HTTP methods (GET, POST), request headers, request body
		   - For HTTP response,
           - HTTP status code, Response headers, response body
		   - Request methods
           i. GET - to retrieve the request
		     ii. POST - to create a new request
           iii. PUT - to update the request
		     iv. PATCH - to update only necessary data within the resource
           v. DELETE - to delete specified resource
		   - Status codes:
           i. 2xx - Successful (200 - OK, 201 - Created)
           ii. 3xx - Redirectional (301 - moved permanently)
           iii. 4xx - Client Error (404 - Not found)
           iv. 5xx - Server Error (500 - Internal Server error)
		   - Advantages of HTTP:
           - requires less memory and CPU usage
         - Diadvantages of HTTP:
           - less secure as there is no encryption method
      2) HTTPS
         - Secure version of HTTP
         - communicate between client and server
         - all data send between client and server is encrypted and can be decrypted. but hackers cannot read or modify it
   g) Client-server Architecture
      - a model that describes how two systems (client and server) communicate with each other over a network (like the Internet or a local network)
      - Client: The client initiates requests, waits for the server’s response, and displays it to the user. For example, a web browser acts as a client when it requests a website.
      - Server: The server processes these requests, retrieves the relevant information, and sends it back to the client. For example, a web server responds with website data when a browser requests it.
      - open any browser and type a URL:
        - The browser (Client) sends a HTTP request to the Server that hosts the site.
        - The server receives the request, processes it (maybe checks a database, runs code, etc.).
        - The server sends back a HTTP response (for example: HTML, CSS, and images).
        - The client receives it and renders (shows) the website.
      - Architecture Diagram:
        User Interface Layer -----> Client (Browser App) -----> Request (HTTP/HTTPS) -----> Server (Web/DB/App) -----> Response (Data/HTML) -----> Displays Results to Client
   h) Ping
      - Ping (Packet Internet Groper) is a basic Internet command used in computer network administration to test and verify the availability of a destination IP address.
	   - It helps users confirm whether the computer they are trying to reach is operational. 
	   - To check the ping of any website that corresponds to your computer, follow the given steps:
	     -> Open Command Prompt or Terminal:
           For Windows, press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
           For Mac/Linux, open the Terminal application.
		  -> In the command prompt or terminal, type the following command:
           ping<space>[website name]
		     Replace [website address] with the URL or IP address of the website you want to check and press Enter. For example, to check YouTube’s ping value:
           ping youtube.com
   i) Traceroute
      - Traceroute shows the path that packets take from your device to a destination (like a website).
      - It lists all intermediate routers (hops) between you and the target server.
      - Helps diagnose network delays or routing issues.
      Ex:
        tracert google.com     # on Windows
        traceroute google.com  # on Linux/Mac
   j) Types of Network
      - LAN
      - WAN
      - MAN
      - PAN
   k) MAC Address (Media Access Control)
      A unique hardware address assigned to every device’s network interface card (NIC).
      Format: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
      Used for communication within a local network (LAN).
      Unlike IP, it never changes — it's tied to hardware.
      Think of it as a device’s physical ID, while the IP is like a temporary address.
   l) Network Devices:
      - Switch
      - Hub
      - Router
      - Modem
      - Firewall
   m) Firewalls and Security Concepts
      - Firewall: Filters incoming/outgoing network traffic based on rules.
      - Proxy Server: Acts as an intermediary between user and internet.
      - VPN (Virtual Private Network): Encrypts your connection and hides your IP.
      - SSL/TLS: Encryption protocols behind HTTPS.
   n) Network Troubleshooting Commands
      - `ping` - Check connectivity - `ping google.com`      
      - `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ifconfig` (Linux) - View IP details - `ipconfig` 
      - `tracert` / `traceroute` - Trace packet path - `tracert google.com`   
      - `nslookup` - Find IP of a domain  - `nslookup youtube.com`
